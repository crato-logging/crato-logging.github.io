        <h3>1.1 What is Crato?</h3>

        <p>
          Crato is an open source framework for small applications to easily
          deploy centralized logging.
        </p>

        <p>
          Applications and system services use messages to record their events,
          but by default these log messages remain on local systems and are
          deleted. Without intervening then, developers and administrators lose
          valuable insight into the history, performance and security of their
          systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Crato employs centralized logging to address this problem. With Crato,
          each machine sends its logs to an offsite collection server, where
          users can gain insight into the entire system by accessing the
          consolidated logs. Log messages are then streamed into Kafka, consumed
          by Crato, and sent as compressed files to Amazon S3 for archiving and
          into InfluxDB for metrics-based querying.
        </p>

        <h2 id="logging">2 Logging</h2>

        <h3>2.1 What is a Log?</h3>

        <p>
          Logs are an essential tool that developers use on a daily basis and in
          the simplest case, we can think of logs as distinct events that get
          written to files<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup
          >. This log data is one of the key elements in determining application
          health, as well as in analysis and debugging, and for deriving useful
          metrics. But most often, especially on a single node system, when
          there is an issue, developers can reach for the appropriate log file
          and look for errors or warnings to understand what went wrong. In
          addition to the error logs that help developers investigate issues,
          event logs across your application's services can also give insights
          on how the application is being used and are essential for performing
          historical analysis to find trends, patterns and user behaviours.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is natural to think of logs as files since normally, the
          environment in which our applications run include a logging system
          that separates the concern of log message processing from the
          components that generate them - one such logging system is syslog; the
          most widely distributed logging protocol that is supported by a wide
          range of devices and processes. Syslog defines a message format as
          well as allows for stanardization of how logs are generated and
          processed.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Logs as Files</h3>

        <p>
          Most often, especially on a UNIX machine, log files can be found in
          the <code>var/log</code> directory and apart from log files that are
          found there, this directory can contain other sub directories
          depending on applications that are running on your system. For
          example, MySQL generates its own log file and the

          <code>httpd</code> sub directory contains the apache web server
          <code>access_log</code> and <code>error_log</code>. There are also
          system processes that can be found in files like
          <code>kern.log</code> or

          <code>auth.log</code> that contain information logged by the kernel
          and system authorization information respectively.
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/logs_as_files.png" alt="Logs as files" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Because log messages are generated by some process and get written to
          files on our local file system, it's natural to think of logs simply
          as files. There are command line utilities that help developers
          interact with log files and we can use commands like

          <code>grep</code> to match against some string or regular expression
          to find what we're looking for. There is a static file, we can sift
          through it and get a result.
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/gifs/grep.gif"
            class="softened"
            id="grep"
            alt="Logs as files"
          />

          <p>
            ex. We can search through a file to look for logs generated in the
            last 10 minutes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          But in order to better understand the structure of application logs
          and before exploring how log messages are generated and processed with
          syslog let's consider another description of what a log is. We know
          that a log is a file but it's not the full story.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Logs as Append-Only Data Structures</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "A log is perhaps the simplest possible storage abstraction. It is
            an append-only, totally-ordered sequence of records ordered by time"
          </p>

          <p>- Jay Kreps</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          In a simple case, if we have an application that runs on a single
          node, the life of the developeer is relatively easy. When the
          application is contained, so is its log data - when something goes
          wrong we know where to look and reading an error message that is
          produced can be easily parsed by a human to find out what the issue
          is. However, as applications continue to grow in complexity so does
          the volume of their log data - the many components, devices and
          microservices that produce log data are often distributed on multiple
          servers and even with a relatively small number of users, this can
          quickly become a big data problem. For this reason there has been a
          greater need to unify log data, both by location as well as format.
          This shift means that while developers still need to access and read
          logs, this strategy becomes quickly unmanageable and so the need for
          machines to read log data instead of humans has risen drastically.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in order for a machine to parse and aggregate log data to
          then be consumed by humans, a text file many not be the best format.
          So if log files are useful for humans to read, what does a log that is
          easier for machines to read look like? How do we store log data, if
          not in a file?
        </p>

        <p>
          If we take a step back and look at a log, not as a file but a data
          structure as described by Jay Kreps in the quote above, we can see
          that logs as files are just a different form of this log concept. The
          log looks like this and has some basic properties:
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/log_data_structure.png" alt="Log" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Each entry in a log is added sequentially making this an append only
          data structure. We start on the left and each subsequent entry is then
          added to the right. The entries on the left are then by definition
          older than entries on the right giving this data structure a natural
          notion of time, even without an explicit timestamp<sup
            ><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup
          >. Since reads also proceed from left to write, in the context of
          building an application, if each entry in a log represents some event,
          we can know the order in which the events occurred, thus building up a
          sort of historical context for our applications.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4 Logs as Streams</h3>

        <p>
          The "Twelve-factor App" is a methodology for building
          software-as-a-service and is a set of guidelines published by Adam
          Wiggins, one of Heroku's co-founders, that addresses the issue of
          logging directly. It says that we should treat logs not as files but
          as event streams and that your application shouldn’t concern itself
          with the storage of this information. Instead, these logs should be
          treated as a continuous stream that is captured and stored by a
          separate service<sup><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course it's natural to think of logs as files in your file
          directory since it's a common way to interact with logs and because
          log file generation is typically an automatic process that happens
          behind the scenes. But log messages simply get written to files since
          it's a convenient method of storing data; individual log messages can
          be viewed as time ordered streams of events that

          <em>can</em> be written to files but that can also be processed in
          other ways. To borrow another quote from Jay Kreps, "Log is another
          word for stream and logs are at the heart of stream processing".
          Streams of data can be directed or split into multiple streams and
          sent to different locations for further processing for example.
        </p>

        <p>
          If we use a command line utility like <code>tail</code> it's possible
          to see a live stream of logs that are coming from an application or
          any other process we'd like to monitor. So while messages are being
          written to files, from this view it's easier to think of logs as a
          collection of events that we can view in real time as they these
          events occur - something that's ongoing, with no beginning or an end.
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/gifs/tail.gif"
            class="softened"
            id="tail"
            alt="Logs as streams"
          />

          <p>
            Ongoing, collated collection of events which we can view in real
            time as they happen.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>2.5 Logs Capture Change</h3>

        <p>
          Knowing a little bit about application logs and the structure of a
          log, let's see why these properties are important and how they can
          help in the context of building an application or running a small
          application in production. To review, a log at its core is an append
          only sequence of records that has a natural notion of "time" because
          newer records are appended to the end of the log. These properties
          that define a log, when taken together can serve a purpose of
          recording what happened and when and because they record a history,
          they capture change of your application over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          We most often think of our application's database, where we keep the
          busines logic of our application to be the source of truth, but
          knowing how we got to a particular state can be even more important.
          This point is well described by the "Stream-Table Duality" concept. It
          is often talked about by figures like Martin Kleppman, Jay Kreps and
          Tyler Akidau and it shows that there exists a close relationship
          between streams and tables.
        </p>

        <h3>2.6 Stream-Table Duality</h3>

        <p>
          Stream-table duality is another way of saying that there are distinct
          but related ways to represent data. The familiar way is of course with
          a table which represents a snapshot of current state. Developers work
          with relational databases on a daily basis and it's the tables that
          represent the business logic of the application that we are talking
          about here. Let's consider a simple example below. There are two users
          and they are transferring funds between one another. As changes occur
          over time, the data in a table is updated to reflect a new current
          state.
        </p>

        <div class="buttons">
          <button id="resetButton" class="cratoButton">Reset</button>

          <button id="nextButton" class="cratoButton">&rarr;</button>
        </div>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/table_states/state1.png"
            id="table-state"
            data-id="1"
            alt="Table State1"
          />

          <p>
            As changes occur over time, the data in a table is updated to
            reflect a new current state. But how did we get there?
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          In this example, we can see that data in tables is mutable since the
          new values in the table come in the form of updates of old ones. When
          we isolate a table and look at it at any point in time, it's possible
          to answer questions about the current state - for example, what

          <em>is</em> the current balance of a customer with username big_ed.
          However, looking only at a database record at one point in time and
          then another is not going to paint a full picture - there are many
          ways you could have gotten from one state to another and it is the log
          that can describe that journey. We have to look at the database's
          change log which is what captures those changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Representing the same history that we saw above but this time as a
          stream of changes would look like this:
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/gifs/stream.gif" alt="Stream" />

          <p>
            A stream captures distinct events; the changes between the table's
            states
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          This time, the data is immutable since the values are not updated; we
          have distinct events and they're appended to the end of the log. What
          is captured in the blue boxes are the changes between the table's
          states. This stream of changes can supplement the core business logic
          that lives in tables and helps answer not only <em>what</em> changed
          or in this example, what is the current balance of one of our users
          but also

          <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> something changed<sup
            ><a href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup
          >.
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/stream_table_duality.png"
            alt="Stream-table duality"
          />

          <p>
            Tables show us current state and streams capture how we got there.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          And a log is useful in another way. It doesn't only supplement static
          data that lives in tables but because it captures all the changes that
          a table underwent, it is possible to aggregate over the stream of
          changes and actually end up with a table again.
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/stream_to_table.png"
            alt="Stream to a table"
          />

          <p></p>
        </div>

        <p>
          In the context of building an application, looking at relevant log
          data from your application can not only give information about what
          changed, but how and why something changed while aggregating over log
          data, it is possible to arrive at a snapshot of your application's
          state at any point in time. In this way, it's possible to think of a
          log as the real source of truth since a log contains the building
          blocks to recreate a table; we can aggregate streams to arrive at
          tables, but looking only at a table we do not know how someone may
          have interacted with our application to end up at that state.
        </p>

        <h3>2.7 Why Does Logging Matter for Small Applications?</h3>

        <p>
          There are obvious benefits to logging that are important in day to day
          development. Developers use logs every day for analysis and debugging,
          infrastructure monitoring and for deriving useful metrics. Some types
          of applications are also required to keep logs long term for audit
          purposes. However, besides these uses, careully curated logs related
          to your application can provide valuable historical context that
          unlocks other benefits:
        </p>

          <li>We can see precisely see how our applications are being used</li>
          <li>Data can be used to find trends, patterns and behaviours</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          For a small but growing application, there are many options to get
          started with logging. Today, given so many options in terms of cloud
          computing and storage it should be relatively easy for a small but
          growing company to get started, however for many companies this is not
          a primary concern as they try to focus on the development of their
          application. Many companies start out without a logging system and
          implement one later but they’ve lost all that log data up to that
          point. If some time down the road they want to perform a historical
          analysis to gain a competitive edge, it is too late. As we'll see, by
          default, log data is deleted off local machines and even if it wasn't,
          the log data from each component in your system is dispersed and not
          usable for any meaningful analysis. In the next section, we will
          discuss the various options that a small but growing application has
          and how they can centralize and store their log data and for that
          we'll need to exlore how logs are generated and processed in the first
          place.

        <h2 id="syslog">3 Syslog</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Single Host Architecture</h3>

        <p>
          In a previous section we talked about how log files are automatically
          generated by a logging system on your operating system by default.
          Syslog is the most widely used logging system and it is a standard for
          recording logging messages especially on UNIX machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's imagine some process or application that is generating log
          messages. What Syslog is responsible for is separating the concern of
          log message processing from the application itself and the way it does
          that is through a syslog daemon that receives messages and performs
          some output action - most commonly writing message to files locally or
          shipping messages to a central location, a server of your choosing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the original inception of Syslog in the 1980's, there are now
          various implementations of the syslog daemon, for example rsyslog or
          syslog-ng being the most notable examples. For the purposes of our
          discussion here, we'll use the generic syslog daemon in our diagrams,
          however any of the more modern implementations can be used in its
          place.
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/syslog_local.png" alt="Syslog local" />
          <p></p>
        </div>

        <p>
          First let's take a look at what syslog looks like locally. In a simple
          case, for example on a single node system, the log daemon will receive
          log messages and then write them to the local file system as we saw
          earlier - typically the files are written to the
          <code>var/log</code> directory on your machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a separate process called "log rotation" that is responsible
          for compressing, archiving and eventually removing old log files. Log
          rotation occurs daily, weekly or when a file reaches a certain size -
          this depends on the configuration that we provide<sup
            ><a href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup
          >. For example, you can choose to keep 3 days worth of logs, in which
          case the log rotation process will rename the log file to make room
          for the next, eventually leaving the latest three files:
          <code>example.log.1</code>, <code>example.log.2</code> and
          <code>example.log.3</code>
        </p>

        <p>
          During the next iteration, the <code>example.log.3</code> file will
          get rotated out and <code>example.log.2</code> file takes its place
          and is renamed <code>example.log.3</code>.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/syslog_local2.png"
            alt="Syslog local on client"
          />
          <p></p>
        </div>

        <p>
          This is the process that occurs behind the scenes in a localized
          system. But applications are rarely deployed on a single node. There
          are typically many moving parts and various components across
          different servers. Each of these components is generating its own log
          data in real time, so the question is how do you as a developer sift
          through this data and correlate events from each component?
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine that you have an error and you need to refer to your logs to
          see what went wrong. In this case you would have to individually
          connect to every single one of the servers one at a time, locate logs
          on each client and try to find the information that you are looking
          for and then try to correlate different events, perhaps by their
          timestamp to understand what went wrong.
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/gifs/local_logging.gif"
            alt="Localized logging"
          />
          <p></p>
        </div>

        <p>
          This is not what we want. Having all these different logs hosted in
          different locations makes the correlation and analysis difficult and
          on top of that, through the process of log rotation, the logs, they
          get rotated out and they're gone forever. Ideally we would bring
          together all these logs into one central place. Luckily Syslog also
          defines a way for us to do that.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Forwarding Messages to a Central Server</h3>

        <p>
          Another possible output action for a syslog daemon is sending messages
          from diferent machines and having another syslog daemon on a central
          server receive them.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/syslog_centralized.png"
            alt="Centralized syslog"
          />
          <p></p>
        </div>

        <p>
          This time, the syslog daemon on each of your components captures log
          messages but instead of writing them to a file, it forwards messages
          to a remote location of your choosing where another syslog daemon
          accepts them. Here, it's possible to view our logs as a consolidated
          whole. Already this is a big improvement from the disjointed scenario
          we had above.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now you can inspect all your logs from a single place and you don’t
          have to rely on connecting to every machine individually, you can
          directly see the logs from the same filesystem. This also makes for a
          far more reliable way to access logs because even if one of these
          clients becomes inaccesible, all logs up to the point of the client's
          failure are already in the central server.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/centralized_logging.png"
            alt="Centralized logging"
          />
          <p></p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Now we have a much more desirable and more manageable situation. What
          we needed is a central location where we can access all our logs from
          the same place and this is the basis for a centralized logging
          architecture. Once all logs that are relevant to your application are
          consolidated in one place their value starts to become more apparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you want to use simple command line utilities like
          <code>grep</code>, ship your logs somewhere else or visualize them
          using the many monitoring and visualization tools that exist, it all
          starts once the logs are centralized. There are many options for how
          to centralize your logs, each of varying difficulty so if you're a
          small and growing application that wants to start managing their logs
          what do you do, what solutions are out there?
        </p>

        <h2 id="current-solutions">4 Current Solutions</h2>

        <p>
          For a small and growing application that wants to manage their own
          logs what solutions exist?
        </p>

        <h3>4.1 The Three Options Overview</h3>

        <p>
          Log management solutions come in three category. Logging as a Service
          (LaaS) are paid, propietary solutions generally on the cloud. Doing it
          Yourself (DIY) means building a custom, self-hosted solutions built
          out of a mix of tools. Open-source software (OSS) solutions are a
          category covering open-source tools and inhabited by the two main
          open-source log management optins in the Elastic Stack and Graylog.
        </p>

        <h3>
          4.2 LaaS: Full Service Log Management
        </h3>

        <p>
          There are many paid Logging as a Service (LaaS) products that cover
          the full stack of management. These products comprise of 5 key
          functions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Log Collection</li>
          <li>Ingestion &amp; Storage</li>
          <li>Search &amp; Analysis</li>
          <li>Monitoring &amp; Alerts</li>
          <li>Visualization &amp; Report</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          LaaS solutions are generally cloud-based. They&#39;re easy-to-use,
          provide technical support, and a rich feature set. The most involved
          part is configuring your machine(s) to forward your logs and they
          handle the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The drawbacks however are fairly apparent. Cost can rise quickly and
          depend on many factors. These factors commonly including the volume of
          data being ingested, the number of users, and a monthly service
          fee(s). As a LaaS, a primary goal is to avoid churn and maintain
          revenue by creating dependency and vendor lock-in. Whether cloud-based
          or on-premise, propietary solutions are marked by a lack of data
          ownership in security, relatively small data retention length measured
          in weeks or months and/or running propietary code that can&#39;t be
          inspected by a customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          These drawbacks lead developers to consider whether building their own
          might be better over the long run.
        </p>

        <h3 id="diy">4.3 DIY</h3>

        <p>
          If you decide to Do It Yourself (DIY), there are many products that
          cover and overlap one or some of the 5 key components of a LaaS. These
          5 components can be simplified into 4 phases of log management:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Log Collection</li>
          <li>Processing &amp; Aggregration</li>
          <li>Ingestion &amp; Storage</li>
          <li>Monitoring &amp; Visualization</li>
        </ol>

        <p>{Insert Diagram}</p>

        <h4 id="collection">4.3.1 Collection</h4>
        <p>
          Log collection starts on each machine with a logging system such as
          Syslog listening for messages generated by its applications.
        </p>

        <h5 id="syslog-protocol-its-implementations">
          4.3.1.1 Syslog Protocol &amp; its Implementations
        </h5>
        <p>
          On an individual machine, the Syslog daemon (Syslogd) is running and
          listening to messages generated by applications. Syslogd can collect,
          process, and transport log messages. These message conform to a format
          provided by Syslog and are a mix of structured &amp; unstructured
          data.
        </p>
        <p>
          As aforementioned, Syslogd can be replaced by third-party tools,
          called log collector agents, such as rsyslog and syslog-ng. The syslog
          system is standard on Unix-based systems and installable on Windows
          via 3rd party libraries.
        </p>

        <h4 id="processing-aggregration">4.3.2 Processing &amp; Aggregation</h4>
        <p>
          Logs collected on individual machine are often forwarded to a
          centralized server that is able to parse data into formats like JSON,
          enrich it and store it. Of course, aggregation in a central location
          allows for easier tailing and analysis compared to individual
          machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a healthy amount of open source options within this space.
          If processing and aggregation are needed, some of these tools provide
          a DSL for customer parsing into different formats and log enrichment.
        </p>

        <h4 id="ingestion-storage">4.3.3 Ingestion &amp; Storage</h4>
        <p>
          After logs are collected, the goal is to transport them to a storage
          service, often a database, from which they can be searched &amp;
          analyzed. If the data write request volume is small enough, they can
          be directly sent to storage. However, this isn&#39;t scalable. It is
          often more prudent to decouple the ingestion process and a messaging
          system. A messaging system provides more robust reliability, much
          higher data throughput and greater fault-tolerance. These messaging
          systems are designed for multiple publishers to stream data into the
          system and multiple consumers to then pick up and use the data. With
          higher data write frequencies, messaging systems provide the ability
          to batch data and buffer it before being written to a storage system.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many options within this space for ingestion and storage
          services. Some considerations that need to be made:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How much data is being ingested?</li>
          <li>Who is going to be using the data?</li>
          <li>What is the structure of the log?</li>
          <li>What search, analysis and indexing capabilities are needed?</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="monitoring-visualization">
          4.3.4 Monitoring &amp; Visualization
        </h4>
        <p>
          Finally, once data is in a database, we can connect it to a
          visualization tool for more user friendly analysis and reporting. Some
          of these tools also provide alerting and system configuration
          capabilities. The visual representation of data allows users to
          transform and aggregrate in more effective ways. There are many open
          source options at this space as well with Kibana and Grafana as the
          leaders.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you decide to DIY, at each phase of a central log management
          solution there are several options available, but also many
          considerations to be made. Researching and orchestrating them to work
          and scale is also a challenge.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, doing it yourself (DIY) and building a custom system allows
          for greater control and flexibility at the cost of complexity. Custom
          systems address exact needs allowing for high control of storage and
          security.
        </p>

        <h3 id="oss">4.4 OSS</h3>
        <p>
          Open source log management tools are available that allow a developer
          to maintain high data control, ease-of-use closer to LaaS tools, but
          require self-management and hosting. The two main solutions here are
          the Elastic stack and Graylog.
        </p>

        <h4 id="elastic-stack">4.4.1 Elastic Stack</h4>
        <p>
          Elastic is a company that develops a collection of open-source log
          management products designed to work well together. Altogether, they
          have products that cover each of the 4 key phases of centralized log
          management. A very common combination of their tools: The text-search
          storage system Elasticsearch, log collection and storage service
          Logstash and visualization/monitoring tool Kibana is known as the ELK
          stack.
        </p>
        <h4 id="graylog">4.4.2 Graylog</h4>
        <p>
          Graylog is a company and open-source centralized log management
          server. It is built on top of Elasticsearch and MongoDB and offers a
          web interface connected to the server.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Elastic Stack and Graylog are very popular open-souce self-hosted
          solutions and offer expected usability, high data ownership and
          security. A rich ecosystem of plugins exists for each tool offering
          extended flexibility. However, complexity from these systems comes
          from configuration, deploying scaling up and orchestration related to
          these challenges.
        </p>

        <h3 id="summary-current-log-management-options">
          4.5 Summary: Log Management Options
        </h3>
        <p>
          LaaS tools are easy to use, but offer low data ownership and
          potentially high monetary costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          DIY offers high data ownership, but some costs in developer time and
          higher complexity in building a custom system.
        </p>
        <p>
          OSS tools are free and offer high data ownership, but scaling and
          maintenance are still somewhat complex.
        </p>

        <h2 id="crato-design">5 Crato Design</h2>

        <p>
          The above discussion of current log management options reveals the
          niche that Crato addresses. While LaaS options provide the quickest
          and most simple path, their advantages come with costs. Not only must
          users pay for LaaS services, but their applications' data is yielded
          to a third party. DIY options grant users the most control, and can be
          designed and built to include precisely the features wanted. But there
          are tradeoffs here as well. The high level of control and
          customizability comes with increased complexity and additional design
          and maintenance committments. Finally, the pre-designed OSS options
          aim to split the difference between LaaS and DIY. OSS options return
          data control to the users (typically lacking in LaaS) while reducing
          complexity and design and maintenance commitments (both of which tend
          to be high in DIY projects).
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img

            alt="2-axis-comparison"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          But even here in the OSS options, there is a range of complexity,
          which is largely attributable to the database and full-text search
          choices of the OSS stacks. Crato reduces complexity even more by
          eliminating the need to set up and maintain a full-text search engine.
          Thus, Crato is designed to provide the core features of centralized
          logging while reducing complexity and time commitments.

          5.2.1 Crato Client
        </h4>

        <p>
          Crato Client is designed to have a light footprint on each client
          system. Downloading the client adds only two files to each system: the
          <code>crato</code> bash script and <code>crato-config</code>, a text
          file to record user preferences. Running Crato client interferes with
          the native logging of the system as little as possible. Crato adds
          only a single configuration file that supplements, not overrides,
          default settings.
        </p>

        <p>
          To download Crato client, <code>curl</code> or <code>wget</code> the
          script from {url}.
        </p>

        <h4 id="cratoconfig"><code>crato-config</code></h4>

          />
        </div>

        <p>
          To simplify deployment and reduce complexity, the Crato client cli
          exposes only a handful of configuration options. Crato client
          configuration options are set in the <code>crato-config</code> text
          file. Using key-value pairs, enter any number of logs for Crato to
          track, along with their tags and severity levels. Then enter the ip
          address of the central server.
        </p>

        <p>
          For users needing more granular control over settings, the full range
          of configuraton options are available by directly editing the default
          <code>*.conf</code> files. Because Crato does not override
          applications' logging processes, these can be configured as before.

          configuration is appropriate for Crato client. It then dynamically
          generates a <code>/etc/rsyslog.d/49-crato.conf</code> file to hold
          Crato configuration, and checks the validity of the resulting
          <code>rsyslog</code> configuration. It then either throws an error

        <p>
          So far, the logs are grouped into a single stream, which is being
          written to a single file. This occurs on each client (physical machine
          or virtual server). But the primary goal of centralized log management
          is to collect logs from many different sources into a single, central
          (offsite) location. To accomplish that goal, we need to ship the logs
        </p>

        <p>
          Each system running a Crato client forwards the stream of captured log
          messges via <code>tcp</code> to the offsite core of Crato's
          infrastructure. To mitigate message loss resulting from a network
          partition or problems with the central server, each Crato client
          implements a disk-assisted memory queue in front of the forwarding
          action.
        </p>

        <p>
          WHY DEFAULT TO TCP?: at our expected volumes, the disk-assisted memory
          queue (a linked list capable of holding 10000 individual log messages,
          with 1Gb disk space available if needed) should mitigate the need to
          fire and forget to keep up with traffic. Thus, Crato opts for TCP and
          its guarantees of delivery and packet order over UDP's potential speed
          gains and absence of guarantees.

          As it receives new log events from the dispersed clients, the central
          log server appends each message to its own log file. At this point,
          the central collection server's <code>syslog</code> file contains all
          captured messages from the clients along with those from the
          collection server itself. The full text is available for CLI query
          using familiar text processing tools like <code>grep</code>,

          6.3.1 We Need to Store Logs...but How?
        </h4>

        <p>
          It is common practice for log management systems to persist log data
          not only to save it from automatic log rotation jobs, but also to
          facilitate metrics and other system analysis. Crato follows this
          practice as well, with logs being saved for archiving and also made
          available for querying.
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img

            alt="Central server sending logs to two datastores"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          But then couldn't Crato's central server send logs directly to the
          persistence layer? Yes, in fact it's earliest iterations did exactly
          that, but this approach is sub-optimal for a number of related
          reasons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Logs are produced at different rates than they are consumed.
          Furthermore, the same log data will be used by multiple processes.
          Each use can be expected to have different needs, to operate at a
          different rate, and to have potentially different bottlenecks or
          failure rates. As a result, sending a copy of each log message to each
          consumer as they come in is likely to lead to dropped messages with no
          good way of recovery. Crato needed a buffering system to capture logs
          and allow each consumer to draw data at its own rate.
        </p>

        <p>
          One way to address this problem would be to use a queue. Log messages
          are sent into a queue, and a consumer shifts the next message off as
          needed. This may would work well for an individual consumer, but Crato
          needs to handle multiple consumers, and as each consumer grabs the
          next available message from the queue, all the others miss out. The
          message is no longer available. What Crato would need would be a queue
          in front of each potential consumer. To implement that, the central
          server would need to send a copy of each log message to n queues in
          front of n consumers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another potential solution would be to use a publish-subscribe
          messaging system. The central server would publish each new log
          message to the platform, and all subscribers would receive the log as
          it is available. While this model allows the central server to forward
          its stream to a single destination, it does not account for the
          different rates of consumption.

        <p>
          What Crato needs is a way to provide the same stream of log messages
          to multiple consumers, to allow producers and consumers to work at
          their own paces, and for each to always be able to resume its work at
          the exact point it left off. It needs the advantages of a queue and a
          pub-sub system folded into a single platform. Apache Kafka provides
          exactly that.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The consumer group concept in Kafka generalizes these two concepts.
            As with a queue the consumer group allows you to divide up
            processing over a collection of processes (the members of the
            consumer group). As with publish-subscribe, Kafka allows you to
            broadcast messages to multiple consumer groups.

            <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#kafka_mq">
              Kafka as a Messaging System
            </a>
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          By decoupling log creation or ingestion from log use, Kafka solves the
          problem noted above, namely Crato's need for exactly once delivery of
          log messages to multiple users operating at different paces. At the
          same time, it also allows Crato to be more extensible in the future.
          Any additional uses for the same data can be added as consumers.
        </p>

        <p>
          But if Kafka is so effective at managing this decoupling, wouldn't
          Crato benefit from skipping the central server model and simply have
          each client produce directly to remote Kafka brokers instead? There
          are advantages to this approach. It would reduce complexity in Crato's
          core infrastructure, and there is no doubt that Kafka could handle the
          load from multiple distributed clients as well as it does from a
          single central log server.
        </p>

        <p>
          That said, this design would increase the complexity on the client
          side by introducing additional configuration requirements and
          dependencies. If we want to use the <code>syslog</code> protocol on
          each client (see the justification above), then an
          <code>rsyslog</code> central server poses fewer problems for client’s
          installation. Also, removing the central server would eliminate one of
          Crato's UI advantages, because without a central collection point it
          would lose the ability to provide system-wide observability using the
          familiar *nix text processing tools. One of the design goals is 'easy
          to use'. Asking users to query Kafka for observability pushes hard
          against that goal.

          With Kafka in place, Crato's central collection server sends plain

          Crato with a single Kafka broker revealed that the broker would not
          always be available to receive messages. To reduce the potential for
          log loss, Crato is now built with a three broker Kafka cluster, thus
          preserving service even if two brokers fail. Additionally, it employs
          on its central server a disk-assisted memory queue to mitigate
          partitions between server and Kafka cluster, and to provide an
          emergency store of unsent messages if <code>rsyslogd</code> shuts
          down, or in the event that all Kafka brokers are down.

        <p>
          Although the logs are buffered, and Kafka provides delivery guarantees

          automatic. That is, Kafka will hold the messages for their specified
          time-to-live (pending available disk space), but the consumers must
          make the requests and manage flow to suit their endpoint's needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result of this pull model, Crato is built with two consumer
          groups, one for batching and one for streaming. The batching consumers
          save logs to a json file until it reaches a configurable size, and
          then send the file to Amazon S3 Glacier. The streaming consumers
          filter incoming log messages and serve them to their appropriate
          measurements in InfluxDB.

        <p>
          In order to provide the full advantages associated with centralized
          logging, a platform would need to store logs and to make them
          available for queries. This could be accomplished with a single data
          store, but Crato distinguishes between two very different needs here.
          First, (as discussed above) there is value in archiving logs, i.e.
          setting them aside in files for long-term preservation. Second,
          storing individual log messages for metrics based queries provides
          unique insight into a system's performance. Crato's storage is
          designed with the idea that these different needs should be addressed
          separately. As a result, Crato uses two forms of storage.
        </p>

          are handled directly through Amazon.

        <p>
          Using S3 for log file archiving gives Crato's users offsite storage
          with 99.99..% durability and automatic lifecycle management
          (configured via AWS console) at a competitive price. Furthermore,
          because Crato archives in JSON format, the files themselves are
          queryable from AWS console. As a result users may have an easier time
          determining which files they wish to extract.

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Time is one axis when TS data is plotted on a graph</li>
          <li>Relationships between entities (tables) not important</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Time Series Databases</b>: databases built for collecting, storing,
          retrieving &amp; processing TS data
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Retention policy / aggregation of fine-grained data as it ages
          </li>
          <li>Query &amp; summarization tools</li>
          <li>Integration with metrics visualization tools</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Although other forms of database can be used for time series data,
          they often lack the tooling to make working with time series easy .
          For example, running a continuous query over a short retention period
          measurement allows live monitoring of a server's response rate. Also,
          time series databases tend to be optimized for fast indexing by time.
          While other database types tend to slow down due to indexing as the
          data set grows, time series databases tend to keep a consistently high
          ingestion rate.

          6.4.4 Queryable Storage: InfluxDB
        </h4>

        <p>
          Crato deploys an instance of InfluxDB for queryable storage. Since
          most time series databases have similar optimizations, and they tend
          to be immersed in an ecosystem that allows easy integration with
          visualization tools, the decisive factor in using Influx is the fact
          that it is schema-free. As a result, when a Crato consumer sends logs
          to InfluxDB it automatically creates a new measurement (table) for
          each new log source. That means that Crato's users can benefit
          immediately, and will also be able to add new clients without having
          to declare new schema.

          7.1 Collect Logs
        </h3>

        <p>
          How to efficiently and reliably collect logs without imposing on the
          developers' application code?
        </p>

        <p>Common collection options not chosen by Crato:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Install active collection agent on users' servers
            <ul>
              <li>Pros: Crato would have control</li>
              <li>
                Cons: invasive; violates goal of being lighweight; risks of
                adding code into an untested environment
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrate with an application logging library
            <ul>
              <li>Pros: many libraries already familiar to developers</li>
              <li>
                Cons: narrows the scope of users to those using a particular
                library or framework; likely to not incorportate web server logs
                or system logs
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Crato's approach: Adapt <code>rsyslogd</code>, an already in place
          system-level logging daemon to collect from applications as well.
          Create customized configurations that supplement, not override,
          existing <code>rsyslog</code> configurations.
